 SaaS Version of GeminiLens: "GeminiLens AI Suite"   


 3. Unique Differentiators to Stand Out
Multi‑Modal Ingestion

Beyond images/PDFs: allow audio (podcasts, recorded meetings) → transcript → contextual Q&A.

Collaborative Annotation

Real‑time shared sticky‑note sessions: teammates can highlight, comment, upvote notes, and see each others’ cursors.

Domain‑Specific AI Plugins

Offer “modes” or fine‑tuned adapters for legal, medical, engineering—so that contracts, clinical studies, or technical specs get far better answers.

“Meeting Mode”

Connect to Zoom/MS Teams, live‑capture slides, transcript, and auto‑summarize discussion as sticky notes, action items, and deadlines.

Export & Integrations

One‑click export of notes+chat into Markdown, PDF, or push directly into Notion/Confluence/Jira.

Browser Extension

Instantly “send to GeminiLens” from any webpage or web‑app—snap an image, grab selected text, or free‑type a question.
